Project: Image Resizer API Requirements:

Upload Image: Allow users to upload an image file via an API. Accept common formats like JPEG, PNG, GIF. 
Resize Image: Use a library like Sharp to resize the image based on user input (width, height). Maintain 
aspect ratio if only one dimension is provided (width or height). Return Resized Image: After resizing, 
return the resized image for download or display. API Routes: POST /upload: Upload the image and resize 
it based on provided dimensions. GET /download/:imageId: Download the resized image. Error Handling: Handle 
invalid file types, large file sizes, and resizing errors. Bonus: Allow users to specify image format (JPEG, PNG) 
after resizing. Add basic watermarking functionality as an optional feature. This project is small and 
focuses on essential skills like file upload, image manipulation, and API handling, making it ideal for 
a one-day task. you can include svg make front end in react js
